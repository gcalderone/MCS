This directory contains the test suite for MCS software. These program can be
used to check if the MCS software work correctly, and even as an example on
how to write additional code.

Before running the programs you should check that you have:
 - a MySQL server running
 - a database named 'test'
 - a MySQL account (username 'mcstest' and password 'mcstest') that can create
   tables in the 'test' database, this can be done on a mysql client program
   with the following SQL statement:

   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON test.* TO mcstest@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'mcstest';


The programs can be compiled using the command 'make -f Makefile_test' in this
directory. The entire suite can be executed using the command 'make -f Makefile_test test'.
